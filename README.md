# My Planning process
## Ideation
Since this is my capstone project, I wanted a really impressive and unique concept for an
application that would catch employers' eyes. I struggled with it for a while
until one day when I created a Google spreadsheet to track my job search
efforts. I was once told that anytime you use a spreadsheet for something other
than calculations or reporting of some sort, it's
an indication that an application should be written to do that work instead. Hence
Job Seeker.

## Design and Planning
I began my planning by reading the project requirements, and creating wireframes.
Then I created some user stories, and an [agile board](https://trello.com/b/7amUjo1E/capstone-project) to represent the tasks that needed to be accomplished. Once I decided to use Ember, I planned out my routes and
components as well.

# User Stories and Wireframes
## User Stories
- As a User, I want to save Company Name and Job Titles that I want to apply for so that I can track my job search progress.
- As a User, I want to save the URL of the job opening, if applicable, so I can see the details and apply.
- As a User, I want to save the date that I applied for a job so I can tell whether I applied or not.
- As a User I want to save the name, phone number, and email address of the Recruiter so that I know whom my contact is at the company.
- As a User I want to know whether an offer was made or not
- As a User I want to know whether Iâ€™ve accepted a job offer or not.

# My Development Process
I started by implementing the List Jobs route, then added Delete. Then I
started Create.  I already planned to have a component to enter Job information
that would be shared between Create and Update, but I did not create that
component when I implemented Create. I wanted to get the basics working, and I
decided to implement the job-input component when I did the Update. After Create
I implemented the Show Job route, then I moved on to Update.

I spent a *lot* of time on Update. I created the job-input component and copied
the form fields from Create into it. While working on Update, I did all the
formatting and the work to make the date and the Status dropdown functional. The
Status dropdown was particularly challenging because Ember does not have a
build in dropdown helper. I did find an addon (emberx-select) that looked
promising, but at I couldn't get it working because I didn't realize that I
needed to restart my ember server every time I installed an addon, so I
just used a plain, old html select element instead. I also installed the
ember-truth-helpers addon so I could determine which item in the dropdown
should be selected on Update.  Once the Update was working (and looking) the
way I wanted it to, I moved on to refactoring create.

Refactoring Create really brought home the power of Components to me. It
took me literally 5 minutes to take out my old form, and drop in the job-input
component. It just worked, and going forward, any changes that I needed to make
to the component immediately applied to both Update and Create.  While I was working
on Update, I created another component that I didn't initially plan on. When
I was formatting the text input fields, I started to copy/paste the divs
with the classes I needed on each input field. Right away I realized that I
could create a text-input component which made my job-input template much
simpler and easier to read.

# Additional Features and Improvements Planned
- Add search functionality so the user can narrow down the job listing by
Company, Status, Title, etc.
- Add tracking for interviews. A job opportunity could have multiple interviews,
phone, in-person, etc.
- Import job listings from 3rd party APIs such as Glassdoor, LinkedIn, etc.
- I'd like to implement validators to validate the form input.
- I want to refactor my Status dropdown to use the emberx-select addon
- I want my index page to display different content depending on whether you're
logged in or not.

# A Message for my Colleagues
Best of luck with your future careers!
